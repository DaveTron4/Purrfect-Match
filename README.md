# Web Development Project 4 - *Purrfect Match*

Submitted by: **David Salas Carrascal**

This web app: **Purrfect Match is a fun web app for cat lovers who want to find the perfect cat without any surprises. It lets you browse random cats and filter out specific traits you don't like, like breed, weight, or lifespan.When you come across a cat that has something you’d rather avoid, just click to ban that trait, and it won’t show up in future searches. Whether you’re looking for a specific breed or want to skip certain characteristics, Purrfect Match helps you find your ideal feline friend, all while keeping it fun and easy.No more scrolling through cats that don’t match your vibe—just the ones you want to see!**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed: 

- [x] **Application features a button that creates a new API fetch request on click and displays at least three attributes and an image obtained from the returned JSON data**
  - The type of attribute displayed for each image should be consistent across API calls (i.e. if you are using a cat API, and display the color, breed, and age in response to an initial API call, subsequent button clicks should also result in the color, breed, and age being displayed)
- [x] **Only one item/data from API call response is viewable at a time and at least one image is displayed per API call**
  - A single result of an API call is displayed at a time 
  - Displayed attributes should match the displayed image (i.e., if showing a picture of a Siamese cat and the attribute breed, the displayed breed should be 'Siamese' not 'Ragdoll' or another breed that doesn't match)
  - There is at least one image per API call
- [x] **API call response results should appear random to the user**
  - Clicking on the API call button should generate a seemingly random new result each time
  - Note: Repeat results are permitted but the API used should have a reasonably large amount of data and repeats should not be frequent
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban **list**
  - At least one attribute for each API result should be clickable
  - Clicking on a clickable attribute not on the ban list, should imnmediately add it to the ban list 
  - Clicking on an attribute in the ban list should immediately remove it from the ban list 
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**
  - Clicking on the API call button should not result in any image/attributes with attribute values in the ban list being displayed (ex. Using a cat API, if the ban list includes the value 'Siberian' for the breed attribute, clicking on the Discover button should never result in a Siberian cat being displayed)
  - Note: More attribute values on the ban list may result in a higher frequency of repeat results
  -  [x] _To ensure an accurate grade, your recording **must** show that when clicked, an attribute in the ban list is immediately removed from the list of banned attributes_


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes are clickable and can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously displayed  results from this session
  - A dedicated section of the application displays all the previous images/attributes seen before
  - Each time the API call button is clicked, the history updates with the newest API result

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. What I struggled the most with was trying to find out how to get the API call to not include the banned attributes. I thought there was a way to include the banned words in the url to ignore, that was not the case. In the end what worked was using an if statement to check if any of the banned words where in the json fetched and, if so, call the function again. I could've done it so that it loops until it finds one but I wanted to only try five times and if doesn't get it raise an error. That way I could demonstrate that banning words works.
